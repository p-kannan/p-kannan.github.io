#### How Tumor Vessels Shape Treatment Response
We explore the structural and functional changes in tumor blood vessels that occur during therapy, focusing on how these changes affect drug delivery and resistance to treatment.

#### The Role of Stress Pathways in Tumor Microenvironments
Our work delves into key stress-response pathways, such as p53 signaling, to understand how tumors adapt to the pressures of treatment and thrive under hostile conditions.

#### Developing Tools to Study Tumor Dynamics
We create and apply advanced imaging technologies and computational frameworks to study how tumors evolve, enabling us to visualize the intricate interactions within the tumor ecosystem.
